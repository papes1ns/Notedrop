# Notedrop
Content feed where students can share information about their currently enrolled courses (documents, posts, pictures, etc)

This was started as an independent study project by Nathan Papes.
Current versions will be running at 52.26.203.237.

## TODO
- [x] Script that imports data for colleges and state names
- [x] Subscribe to sections (if not present, create new one)
- [x] Feed of posts from other students in the same classes
- [ ] Algorithm for feed post order
- [x] Rating system for posts (archive post based on downvotes)
- [ ] Email users when post has certain # of upvotes (option to turn off)
- [ ] Form input validation and cleaning
- [x] User profiles with their posts
- [ ] Support file uploads in posts
- [ ] Site fully hosted and running on web server


### Thoughts
* I think it would be cool to have a feature that adds a post to a notebook and
then have to option to export all your favorited notes to a doc or pdf
* Websockets for instant notification on new posts would be cool.
* Use a modern frontend framework should as reactJS or angularJS.
